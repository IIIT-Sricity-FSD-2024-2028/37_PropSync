**PropSync**  
Property Management and Service Coordination System

**Problem Statement \-** 

In many residential societies and gated communities, property maintenance and service coordination are still handled through informal channels such as phone calls, WhatsApp messages, or manual registers. Maintenance requests raised by residents often lack proper tracking, priority handling, and accountability. This results in delayed responses, poor coordination between maintenance managers and service providers, unclear cost approvals, and dissatisfaction among residents.

Additionally, there is limited transparency regarding service provider performance, maintenance history, and cost management. Maintenance managers spend significant time manually coordinating tasks, negotiating service costs, and following up on pending work, leading to inefficiencies and increased operational overhead.

**Propsync**  aims to address these challenges by providing a centralized digital platform that streamlines maintenance request handling, improves coordination among stakeholders, ensures accountability, ensures maintenance requests are processed within defined time limits, with visibility into delays and pending actions and enhances overall property management efficiency while keeping all decision-making authority with designated management roles.
