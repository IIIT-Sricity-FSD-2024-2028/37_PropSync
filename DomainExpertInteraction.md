**Actors and Responsibilities :**   

**1\. Owner**   
**Role:** Property Stakeholder / Asset Owner  
**Responsibilities:**  
   Owns the property and authorizes maintenance policies.  
   Views maintenance status, costs, and service history.  

**2\. Admin**
**Role:** System Administrator  
**Responsibilities:**  
    Manages system configuration and user accounts.  
    Defines roles, permissions, and workflows.  
    Maintains master data (properties, categories, vendors).  
    Monitors overall system usage and performance.

**3\. Maintenance Manager**
**Role:** Operational Controller  
**Responsibilities:**  
    Reviews and approves maintenance requests.  
    Assigns service providers to maintenance tasks.  
    Approve or Reject Maintenance Cost.
    Monitors work progress and ensures SLA compliance.  
    Verifies service completion and closes requests.
    

**4\. Service Provider**  
**Role:** Maintenance Executor  
**Responsibilities:**  
   Accepts or rejects assigned maintenance tasks.  
   Performs repair or service activities on-site.  
   Submits work completion reports and cost details.  
   Coordinates with the Maintenance manager for clarifications.

**Core workflows**  
**Workflow 1:** Maintenance Request → Approval → Closure  
**Trigger:**  
 Owner raises a maintenance request for a property issue.  
**Steps:**

1. Requests are submitted through the system with issue details.  
2. The maintenance manager reviews requests for validity and urgency.  
3.  Approves or rejects request.  
4.  If approved, the request moves to service provider assignment.  
5. The service provider completes the task and submits a completion report.  
6. The maintenance manager verifies work and updates status.  
   **End / Outcome:**  
    The maintenance request is successfully closed, recorded in history, and stakeholders are notified.

## **Workflow 2: Service Provider Assignment & Task Execution.**

**Trigger:**   
 The maintenance request is approved and ready for execution.  
**Steps :** 

1. The maintenance manager selects an appropriate service provider from registered vendors.  
2. Assigns tasks along with priority, deadline, and instructions.  
   Service provider accepts or rejects tasks. If accepts, provider will submit the service cost Estimate.
3. Maintenance Manager will approve or reject the service cost Estimate.
4. If approved Service Provider executes maintenance work at the property site.  
5. Updates task status, uploads reports/photos, and notes any additional costs.  
6. The maintenance manager reviews completion reports and confirms task closure.  
   **End / Outcome:**  
    Work is completed, validated, and service provider performance is recorded.  
     
   

**Rules, Constraints, and Exceptions**

**Mandatory Rules / Policies**  
These are non-negotiable domain rules.

1. No maintenance work can begin without approval, except emergencies.  
2. Only authorized roles can approve maintenance and costs.  
3. Service providers must be registered in the system before assignment.  
4. Every maintenance request must have a status (raised, approved, in progress, closed).  
5. High-cost repairs require owner-level approval.  
6. Work completion must be verified before closing a request.  
7. Maintenance history must be preserved for auditing and reference.

**Constraints and Limitations**  
These define boundaries of operation.

1. Budget constraints limit approval of expensive maintenance tasks.  
2. Service availability depends on vendor schedules and skills.  
3. Response time constraints based on SLAs.  
4. Regulatory constraints related to safety and building compliance.  
5. System access constraints based on role permissions.  
6. Operational constraints during holidays or non-working hours.

**Exceptions (Real-World Deviations)**  
These are situations where normal rules are bypassed.

1. **Emergency Maintenance**
   Immediate action without prior approval (fire, water leakage, power failure).
2. **Service Provider Rejection**  
   The assigned provider may reject due to unavailability or skill mismatch.  
3. **Cost Overrun**  
   Actual repair cost exceeds approved estimate → re-approval required.  
4. **SLA Breach**  
   Service delay triggers escalation to higher authority.  
5. **Partial Completion**
   Work completed in stages due to dependency on materials or approvals.

**Situations Where Things Go Wrong**  
These are typical real-life pain points.

1. Delayed approvals cause maintenance backlog.  
2. Wrong service provider assignment leads to rework.  
3. Lack of communication creates dissatisfaction.  
4. Untracked requests result in missed issues.  
5. Poor documentation causes disputes over cost or quality.  
6. No escalation mechanism leads to unresolved complaints.

   

**Current Challenges and Pain Points**

**1\. Key Challenges**  
      1\. Maintenance requests are scattered across calls, WhatsApp, and verbal communication.  
      2\. Approval authority is unclear or inconsistent.  
      3.Service provider coordination depends heavily on manual follow-ups.  
      4.Maintenance history is poorly documented or lost over time.  
      5.Cost tracking is reactive rather than controlled.

**2\. Most Difficult or Inefficient Parts of the Process**

   **Most Problematic Stages** 

1. **Request Approval Stage**
   Requests wait for a decision due to unavailability of approvers.  
   No clear priority mechanism exists.
2. **Service Provider Assignment**  
   Matching the right vendor to the issue is time-consuming.  
   Availability and skill information is often outdated or assumed.
3. **Work Completion Verification**  
   No standard method to confirm quality of work.  
   Disputes arise due to lack of evidence or documentation.

**3\. Where Delays, Errors, or Misunderstandings Usually Occur**

1. **Delays**
     Waiting for approval from owners or senior managers.  
     Vendor response delays due to poor communication.
2. **Errors**
     Assigning the wrong service provider due to unclear issue description.  
     Duplicate maintenance work caused by poor tracking.  
3. **Misunderstandings**  
     Scope of work not clearly communicated to service providers.  
     Cost expectations not aligned before work starts.



**4\. Hardest Information to Track or Manage Today**

1. **Real-Time Status of Maintenance Requests**     
     Manual tracking leads to uncertainty about the current state.
2. **Service Provider Performance History**     
     Decisions are based on memory instead of data.
3. **Actual vs Estimated Maintenance Cost**     
     Cost overruns are discovered too late.
4. **Maintenance History by Asset**     
     No centralized asset-wise service records.
5. **Accountability Records**    
     Difficult to identify who approved, delayed, or closed a task.

**5\. Assumptions and Clarifications**

 **A. Assumptions Made by the Team That Were Confirmed** 

1. **Maintenance coordination is mostly manual**  
    Confirmed through domain discussions and observation.  
2. **Delays are more administrative than technical**  
    Most issues are caused by approvals and communication, not repair complexity.  
3. **Service provider quality varies significantly**  
    Reliable performance data is rarely maintained.

 **B.  Assumptions That Were Corrected** 

1. **Assumption:** Tenants always raise maintenance requests      
   **Correction:** In many cases, managers or owners raise requests directly.

2. **Assumption:** Cost is discussed before work starts    
   **Correction:** Costs are often finalized after work completion

3. **Assumption:** Maintenance closure means work satisfaction 
   **Correction:** Closure often happens without proper verification.

   

**Open Questions That Need Follow-Up**

**These are important unresolved domain questions.**

1. What cost threshold requires owner-level approval?  
2. How should emergency maintenance bypass normal approval flow?  
3. What evidence is required for service completion verification?  
4. How are SLA penalties or escalations handled?  
5. Should preventive maintenance be mandatory or optional?  
6. How is vendor performance formally evaluated and recorded?
